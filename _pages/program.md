The RPM workshop has a joint program with the [DQT-PM](https://www.processdataquality.com/dqthome) workshop on the very related topics of Data Quality and Data Transformation. The joint workshop program includes three paper sessions: two full paper sessions and one presentation-only session. The day starts with a keynote provided by *Janina Nakladal*, Director of Sustainability at Celonis and is concluded with a panel discussion for which we have invited Anne Rozinat, Founder of Fluxicon and Sander Leemans, Professor at RWTH Aachen.

## Presentation format

Presentations are grouped with 3 papers and within each group, the authors get 15 minutes to present and 5 minutes for one or two questions from the audience. Each session concludes with a 15 minute panel discussion with all authors. This panel should be prepared by the authors, who are expected to have read the other papers. It will be moderated by the session chair.
